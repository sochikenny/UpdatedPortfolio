            I am an experienced educator and currently the 11th and 12th grade
            Head Math Teacher at Capital Prep Harbor Schools in Bridgeport CT. I
            have both a bachelors and masters degree in mathematics from
            Fairfield University and Ohio University, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently at a transitional stage in my professional career and
            this portfolio is the start of great things to come in the future. I
            am in a Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp at the University of
            Connecticut and eventually, my goal is to fully transition into a
            Software Developer. For more content about my professional
            experience, check out my

            My reason for this shift is so that I can use some of my skills I
            have obtained to affect some change in this tech driven world. Also,
            I want to push the needle in inspiring our black and brown kids to
            start coding. I strongly feel that this skill is essential and that
            everyone should, at the very least, learn a little something about
            it.
